Writedefine-locale, define-item, define-npc which will put the names andobjects into the global list.</p><p class="style1">Write a REPL (read-eval-print loop) which will reada command and call the appropriate function. You can limit yourcommands to zero or one arguments. Write a global command-table whereyou can look up what to call for each command string read. Examples ofcommands might include: </p><p class="style2"> n | s | e | w | u | d<br>rest | wait<br>attack &lt;npc&gt; | fight &lt;npc&gt;<br>loot &lt;npc&gt;<br>speak &lt;npc&gt; | talk &lt;npc&gt;<br>look<br>inventory<br>status<br>give &lt;obj&gt;<br>eat &lt;obj&gt;<br>take &lt;obj&gt;<br>discard &lt;obj&gt; | drop &lt;obj&gt; <br>examine &lt;obj&gt;<br>equip &lt;obj | wear &lt;obj&gt;<br>unequip &lt;obj&gt; | take-off &lt;obj&gt;<br>open &lt;obj&gt;<br>close &lt;obj&gt;</p><p class="style1">Introduce some randomness in your levels so yourgame is not always the same. </p><p class="style1">Keep track of the number of turns the game has run,where each player command is a turn. Have some events triggered atcertain turns (e.g. an npc enters the room where the player is, theplayer hears something, etc.).</p><p class="style1">Always include a word in the item descriptions whichthe player can use to refer to that item (e.g. &quot;a woodenstatuette&quot;). When you read an item name from the REPL, compare itto the descriptions of all items in the locale to find a match.</p><p class="style1">Have some random events occur, as in the example ofthe goblin's behavior above. (e.g. the goblin might emote in one ofseveral possible ways, 30% of the time the player is in the room withit).</p><p class="style1">Drop hints and clues as to the importance ofobjects. Let the player know what he or she should try to do.</p><p class="style1">Add a command &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;help&quot;which will print out a hint, in case the player doesn't know what todo. </p><p class="style1">The best adventure games tell a fun story. Base yourgame locales, items, and npcs around a story, so that the player isentertained as he or she plays the game. </p><p class="style1">Give your game a personality. Strive for evocativedescriptions, surprising items, and interesting npc's.</p><h2 class="style1">Extra Credit (25 points)</h2><p class="style1">One of the weakest points of computer games is npcinteraction. Develop a conversation engine for your game, so theplayer can have a conversation with an npc in the game. The npc'sreactions and statements should depend on what the player has done orsaid.</p><p class="style1">Be creative. Have fun. </p><!-- <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> --><!-- <p class="style1">&nbsp; </p> --><P> Credits: Kaveh Kardan, Academy for Creative Media<!-- <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> --><!-- <p class="style1"><br> --><P>Go to the main  <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~nreed/ics313/assign.html"> assignments page</a>. <P><IMG width="100%" src="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~nreed/images/rainbowbar.gif"> <P></body></html>
